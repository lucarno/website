Welcome! I am associate professor at [Insper Institute for Education and Research](https://www.insper.edu.br), São Paulo, Brazil, where I investigate political representation in the developing world.

I am also an associate at the [Governance and Local Development Institute](https://gld.gu.se/), University of Gothenburg, and a former research fellow at the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse](https://www.iast.fr/) (2016--2018).

My work has been published in the *American Political Science Review*, *American Journal of Political Science*, *British Journal of Political Science*, *Comparative Political Studies*, and the *Journal of Politics*, among others.

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 2015.

**Research interests:** comparative politics, political representation, political parties, clientelism, Brazilian politics.
